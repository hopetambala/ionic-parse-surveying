Here are instructions to get you started.\nContribution guidelines\nPull requests are always welcome\nWe are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and we do our best to\nprocess them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull\nrequest? Do it! We will appreciate it.\nIf your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be\ndiscouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, we'll make sure to provide feedback.\nCreate issues...\nAny significant improvement should be documented as a github\nissue before anybody\nstarts working on it.\n...but check for existing issues first!\nPlease take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist\ndocumenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it\nnever hurts to add a quick \"+1\" or \"I have this problem too\". This will\nhelp prioritize the most common problems and requests.\nConventions\nFork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch.\nMake sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation and\ntests when creating or modifying features.\nPull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a\nreference to all the issues that they address.\nCode review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the\nsuggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Be\nsure to post a comment after pushing. The new commits will show up in the pull\nrequest automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you\ncomment.\nBefore the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into\nlogical units of work using git rebase -i and git push -f. After every\ncommit the test suite should be passing. Include documentation changes in the\nsame commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.\nCommits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like Closes #XXX\nor Fixes #XXX, which will automatically close the issue when merged.\nAdd your name to the AUTHORS file, but make sure the list is sorted and your\nname and email address match your git configuration. The AUTHORS file is\nregenerated occasionally from the git commit history, so a mismatch may result\nin your changes being overwritten.\nDecision process\nHow are decisions made?\nShort answer: with pull requests to the Puente-Ionic-Datacollection repository.\nAll decisions affecting Puente-Ionic-Datacollection follow the same 3 steps:\n\nStep 1: Open a pull request. Anyone can do this.\n\nStep 2: Discuss the pull request. Anyone can do this.\n\nStep 3: Accept or refuse a pull request. A maintainer does this.\n\n\nHow can I become a maintainer?\n\nStep 1: learn the code inside out\nStep 2: make yourself useful by contributing code, bugfixes, support etc.\n\nDon't forget: being a maintainer is a time investment. Make sure you will have time to make yourself available.\nYou don't have to be a maintainer to make a difference on our project!\nWhat are a maintainer's responsibility?\nIt is every maintainer's responsibility to:\n\n1) Deliver prompt feedback and decisions on pull requests.\n2) Be available to anyone with questions, bug reports, criticism etc. on Puente's Ionic Datacollection app.\n\nHow is this process changed?\nJust like everything else: by making a pull request :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n

These hybrid applications include native functionalities, exhaustive gestures, and customizable tools to enhance user-friendliness. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Ionic because it provides mobile-friendly HTML, JS, and CSS components to developers.\nSome of its advantages are:\n\nOpen source\nCode once, run on all mobile devices\nOne programming language for all mobile OS\nUse of well-known web technologies\nA huge community\n\nParse Server\nParse Server is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It works with the Express web application framework and can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself. Its repository is on Github.\nParse offer a backend to store data, push notifications, social media integration for our app etc. The features provided tend to be helpful in prototyping quickly.\n\nGeneral Purpose: Open Source\nHosting: Self-hosting or Parse Server Hosting providers. Supports local testing and development\nCustom Code: Supported via Cloud Code\nDatabase: Mongo DB\nPush: Support push notifications for Android, iOS. Also users can manage Push Notifications campaigns\nStorage: No restricted time limits and no file storage restrictions. Control over backup, restore and database indexes\nIdeal for: General purpose applications\n\nKnown Issues and Troubleshooting\nios-deploy isn't working!\nFrom here\nsudo npm install -g ios-deploy --unsafe-perm=true --allow-rootSometimes running one of ios build scripts\nnpm run ios:builddoesn't work if you have an iPad or iPhone attached to the computer during building.\nDocumentation\nhttps://hopetambala.github.io/puente-ionic-datacollection/\nContribution\n\nReport issues\nOpen pull request with improvements\nSpread the word\nReach out to me directly at hope@puente-dr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Hope Tambala - Free and Open Innovation Lab\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
