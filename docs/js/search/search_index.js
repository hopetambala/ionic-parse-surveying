How Are We Addressing It?          By building customized tech tools for international development! In order to “bridge” the gap between data and development, Puente created a proprietary data collection application as a means to create a reliable database of reliable, quantitative and qualitative data that reflects the development needs of resource-challenged communities.                                                      Let\\'s Tackle This Together          With your data collection, we\\'re one step closer to empowering community development with modern computational tools!

These hybrid applications include native functionalities, exhaustive gestures, and customizable tools to enhance user-friendliness. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Ionic because it provides mobile-friendly HTML, JS, and CSS components to developers.\nSome of its advantages are:\n\nOpen source\nCode once, run on all mobile devices\nOne programming language for all mobile OS\nUse of well-known web technologies\nA huge community\n\nParse Server\nParse Server is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It works with the Express web application framework and can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself. Its repository is on Github.\nParse offer a backend to store data, push notifications, social media integration for our app etc. The features provided tend to be helpful in prototyping quickly.\n\nGeneral Purpose: Open Source\nHosting: Self-hosting or Parse Server Hosting providers. Supports local testing and development\nCustom Code: Supported via Cloud Code\nDatabase: Mongo DB\nPush: Support push notifications for Android, iOS. Also users can manage Push Notifications campaigns\nStorage: No restricted time limits and no file storage restrictions. Control over backup, restore and database indexes\nIdeal for: General purpose applications\n\nKnown Issues\n\nAndroid Production has geolocation issues\nPerformance Issues on older/slower devices\n\nDocumentation\nhttps://hopetambala.github.io/puente-ionic-datacollection/\nContribution\n\nReport issues\nOpen pull request with improvements\nSpread the word\nReach out to me directly at tech@puente-dr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Hope Tambala - Free and Open Innovation Lab\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
