	iOS Quirks
		Since iOS 10 it's mandatory to provide an usage description in the info.plist if trying to access privacy-sensitive data. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this usage description string will displayed as part of the permission dialog box, but if you didn't provide the usage description, the app will crash before showing the dialog. Also, Apple will reject apps that access private data but don't provide an usage description.

		This plugins requires the following usage description:
		NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription describes the reason that the app accesses the user's location.
		To add this entry into the info.plist, you can use the edit-config tag in the config.xml like this:

	<edit-config target="NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" file="*-Info.plist" mode="merge">
	    <string>need location access to find things nearby</string>
	</edit-config>
