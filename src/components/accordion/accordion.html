<div #expandWrapper class='expand-wrapper' [class.collapsed]="!expanded">
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>

<!-- 
  We are using content projection with <ng-content> to project whatever 
  we add inside of the <accordion> tags into the componentâ€™s template. 
  This means that we can display some content here inside of our component.

  We also have a wrapper <div> that has a template variable of expandWrapper so 
  that we can access it later, and the collapsed class is being applied conditionally 
  based on the value of expanded. This is how we will toggle the collapsed styling on and off.
